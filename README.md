Case Study of Diabetes Dataset using CART &amp; Model Performance  Measures , Random Forest , Neural Network

Management of hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients has a significant bearing
on outcome, in terms of both morbidity and mortality. However, there are few
national assessments of diabetes care during hospitalization which could serve as
a baseline for change. This analysis of a large clinical database was undertaken to
provide such an assessment and to find future directions which might lead to
improvements in patient safety.
Based on the given data, build different models to predict whether the patient is
suffering from Diabetes or not? Secondly Compare the model outputs of different
models.
